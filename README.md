Email Spam Detection.
An email spam detection project is a machine learning project that involves building a model to classify emails as either spam or not spam (also known as "ham"). The goal of this project is to help filter out unwanted or malicious emails that can harm users or waste their time.

To build an email spam detection model, a large dataset of emails is typically required. The dataset should contain a mix of spam and ham emails, and should be preprocessed to extract relevant features such as email subject, sender, and content. The dataset can be analyzed to identify any patterns or trends that may be useful for distinguishing between spam and ham.

Once the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned, a machine learning algorithm can be applied to build the classification model. Several algorithms can be used, including naive Bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines. The model is trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on another subset to determine its accuracy.

The final step is to use the trained model to classify new incoming emails as spam or ham. The model can take in the features of an email, such as its subject, sender, and content, and output a prediction of whether the email is spam or not. The accuracy of the model can be continuously evaluated and improved over time by retraining it with new data.

Email spam detection projects are important for protecting users from harmful and unwanted emails. By accurately identifying spam emails, users can save time and reduce the risk of phishing scams or other malicious attacks.
